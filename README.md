# Simple-ChatGPT-Chat-Widget
ChatGPT helped me create a one page inline chat widget that you can add to your websites. Just need to add your API key.

This one is super simple and all inline. Feel free to break apart into appropriate files. To setup:

- Download files
- Add your ChatGPT API to the code by replacing: YOUR_API_KEY

To see a demo, this is being used on https://seventytwo.app
